- filtering: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> As far as I understand now there are three types of filtering of the images: Find window for file names, time line for creation date, and grouping for grouping by folders and tags. I would like to emphasize, that grouping is not exactly filtering, since it shows all the images, not only those you  are looking for.
> From my experience filtering is a much stronger and convenient tool in most working scenarios. So my suggestion is to define most useful attributes (time, folder, file name - that is standard, but add also tags, exif fields) and allow to filter the images by constructing "queries" as any logical combination of those attributes. So that, for example, one could find all images that:
>    (Tag = Home && Tag = Dog && Date = (1/4/03 : 3/6/05) && ! Date(1/2/04:12/3/04) && Flush = 'on' && ! Res < (1024x768))
> This is just illustration of logic, not suggestion  of  required interface, which is a different issue. And that is a "complex" filtering.
> By "simple" I mean to implement only && between the fields, and allow only tags, dates, folders and times, meaning only the attributes you have already implemented queries for, just to do that in form of filters. Even interface is almost ready for that and may require only slight modifications (hopefully :-). Even that simple  implementation may be extremely useful.

x- 1. There's no identification of thumbnails from the Preview Bar that are expanded into the 4 panes - if I'm looking at number of similar photos (which is what Viewer Window is for) - I need to know which is which. The best way to do it, is to identify each one by a surround colour (which right now is blue for thumbnails in the Preview Bar) - so, there's should be four colours for 4 thumbnails and 4 panes.

x- 2. It's more natural to use the mouse drag the thumbnails from the Preview Bar into the panes, then to select the panes and then select the thumbnail to expand it into the pane;

- 3. additional function to, using mouse wheel, to scroll through the Preview Bar and at same time have the four panes show the four expanded thumbnails; however, I sho> (maybe)

- 4. If I select multi-view pane (C), then all four panes should display the first four expanded thumbnails from the current view of Preview Bar, rather than one and 3 blank. (maybe, maybe not!)

x- sorting is broken: "1, 2, 001, 002, 10, 020, 20, 21, 0020, 021", or "1, 2, 001, 002, 10, 20, 020, 21, 0020, 021"
x- viewer zoom: zoom to fit is bogus when image cannot be made bigger than 100% (due to settings) while it should (to fit)
x- retain timestamp while editing photo description!
x- cancel in a histogram with filters is messed up:
	1) create a filter
	2) run the filter with the new rule.
	3) use the original filter bar (date or month) to select a specific day.
	4) press the Escape key supposed to cancel the filtering. This has no effect. Pressing the back key is Okay, but as s soon as the Escape key is pressed the filter is always on with the date selected.
- explorer-like semitransp. selection rect instead of dotted line
- after adding descr. text (F2) it is not immediately available to the preview pane (it'll show up after reloading images)
x- adj. tool - remember last used tab and restore it
- adding stars, switching between folder/date group and rating grouping -> two images disappeared from list ctrl?!

- unify/cleanup exception throwing and catching
- unify/cleanup notification system using signals

- one hot key to turn off the raw files (so that the raw files won't show up in the file list)
- grupping by similarity; show images in stacks, with top image representing similar photos below
x- when applying tag to more than 1 image, show progress bar, and allow operation to be cancelled
x- tagged image is not considered tagged unless reloaded; ctrl+7 moves it into limbo
x- file info dlg: disable next/previous at the end of sequence of images
- fix jpeg decoder to enable decoding at 1/16 the size, apart from half-, quater-, & 1/8-th the size (thumbnail gen. speed)
- CRW doesn't store tags properly (make it xmp-compat)
- tag filter: 'any', 'all' very confusing for "excluded tags"!
x- option to show file names with extension!
x- clicking on timeline drills down, even when it should highlight a day/month (broken, was working)
- add folder rename/delete/create!
x- add file rename and file batch rename!
- add option to show units in detailed view (exposure time 1/60 s, F3.5, exposure bias 0.0 EV, focal length 16.5 mm, image width 2000 px) (a very few columns would use it, and a few others already do as a part of presented info)
- multi folder selection (for image scanning)!!!
x- img rotation buttons in preview pane
- add database of cameras with field of view crop factor; populate it from EXIF data somehow (find out te lowest FL in a bunch of photos); read camera name from EXIF data, supplied factor (guess); export/import/merge of the master table
- provide icons/images that can be used instead of tags
- enable 'define custom columns' when no photos selected
- provide support for Panasonic G1 raw images
- edit XMP inside DNF files (hard)
- XMP bugs (?):
	1. The F2 File Info Dialog should read XMP Contact/Information etc. not IPTC
	2. When I enter a City under IPTC Information this is written to the "city" XMP field but not the "city" IPTC field
	3. When I enter a Creator's City under IPTC Contact this is written to the correct XMP field and to "city" IPTC
	4. Also XMP "Location" strangly goes to IPTC "contact"
- magnif. glass: cross is between pixels, it should be at the center of some pixel (say at x16 is bad, fine at x12)
- shortcut key to switch between hotz/vert pane layout (in a viewer window)
- del in viewer to show a red cross (deleted photo marker) instead of deleting (no confirmation)
- img. viewer: ctrl+num0..9 to rate? (or tag?)
- viewer/preview - zoom in to zoom around the center pixel
- for partially visible photos show/highlight that part that's visible in a preview.
- magnif. glass - should it use original pixels or transformed by a color profile (-> original)?
- show pixel's coordinates? (in magnifier window)
- delete to show a red cross and move img to the trash can area (w/o confirmation), real delete to be postponed
- vert preview bar in a viewer: scrolling by one image ignores text label (at the bottom)
- mosaic disp mode? tiny thumbnails, no space between them, no text label
- calendar view? like a real calendar with photos stacked
x- ctrl+2 in viewer closes viewer wnd!
- transfer tool enhancements to move photos to different folders based on some attribs, like date
- adv. option to keep viewer and main wnd in sync (always), dual monitor users may need that
x- IPTC fields to be available as columns (or at least available to custom columns)
- tagging moves current image (and preview pane shows first image - incorrectly)
- auto hide preview bar in the viewer
- dock tagging bar in the viewer
- adj img brightness/contrast on the fly (non-permanent) in the viewer
- custom/incremental rotate (free angle?)
- customize all toolbars!
- inconsistent ICC profile application (when enabled for wnd/view, but not img, it's aplied in viewer only)
- option to build a tree of folders to scan
- option to clear MRU list of paths/folders
- bug: click on image in explorer window brings up EP, but not entire folder is scanned (scan stops after encountering clicked image)
- allow reading images with broken metadata (broken MakerNotes, ect)
- add ability to collapse filtering pane in user defined filters, and resizing to the ctrl+f filter pane
- extra button to toggle 100% - zoom to fit (and not on a numeric kbd!)
- also it would be nice if when toggling back and forth between 100% and fit to screen, if at 100% the same location was used as last time. So it doesn't always go back to the top left corner
- adj. time -> file info shows cached (old) time, and reflects changes only after reload
- statistical module - charts with selected attrib (focal length, exp. bias, iso, ect.)
- add adv. processing tool that can copy files to different folders, rename them, tag them, etc. (or enhance Transfer tool)
- make MakerNote binary data available to scripts through img.mnote[]; unknown fields could be tested in script
- configure what's displayed as a description of photo in a viewer (any IPTC/metadata field may be good)
- script-based power move/copy tool
x- add mirror option to rotation dlg
x- add option to hide bottom toolbar
- ignore JPEG description/comment field when metadata (IPTC or XML) is present in the photo (to get rid of those persistent comments)
x- multiline image labels
x- increase supported date/time range (that is allow dates below Jan 1 1970)
- GPS editing tool
- resize dialog: add file prefix option apart from a suffix
- add GPS view with a map
- select two images and have kbd option to compare them side by side
- customize toolbar in viewer
- make tool bar (big one) allow access to buttons that are cut off (off-screen)
- if there is a sound file accompanying photo, allow play back
- add ability to update metadata (only select fields) for many images at once (today editing overwrites everything); request is to do it selectively

1) The first would be an ability to read the makernote data that Reconyx Cameras (one of the world's most popular camera traps) add to each photograph, so we could export temperature and moonphase data from each file.
2) We'd love to be able to easily add GPS location data in batches
